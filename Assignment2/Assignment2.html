        <p>Self-care looks different for everyone whether it looks like going on a walk or reading a book. 
            It’s important to take care of one oneself to be able to improve mental, emotional and physical health.
            It can also be hard to find what works for oneself but don’t be afraid to start! If you need a guide this is 
            the right spot to be :) </p>
