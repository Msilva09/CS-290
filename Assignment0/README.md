5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike and ways that you think each of the 5 websites might be improved.

Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/) For Amazon I dislike the way that it is organized! It is super crowded and it can be a pain to search through things.

In addition to this it is very confusing. I always have to go through a million steps to simply check a giftcard information. It can also be very hard to navigate for people that are not super familiar with technology!

One thing I like is that the recommendations are ok formatted. If I am searching for one thing then it has similar products at the bottom.

I think if Amazon simply made the website more simple it would be better. The extra setting paths and pictures are not necessary and confuse people.

Apple (https://www.apple.com/)

For me I also think apple has to much going on on the website. Yes there are sections but those sections just have so many words and it gets confusing as to where Im supposed to press to get to the location I want. Even now when I shop at Apple I still get confused on some of the things that I am searching for.

I like the style (like the color) I think it gives it a higher tech look. Since it looks fancier I really like the glance at the style. However I still don't like the overall crowdiness I get from the website. I think that since it has a fancy view on it making it more simple and direct would also in general be a better approach.

The website does have that fancy interactive side to it so I think if it was more direct with each content it would be a better website. I just think about people that struggle more with technology and the apple website is not easy for them to interact with.

Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/)

I love the Spotify website I think it has a great tone to it and is easy to interact with. It is very direct you can go Home with different sections, search, playlists and library.

I think it does a great job by seprating songs into sections that way the music does not feel overcroweded and it is easier to navigate.

The color theme is also very mellow and laid back which I really like and think is cool.

The settings are also not confusing they are pretty short and straight to the point.

One improvement I would make is maybe letting the user change the color of the background. Sometimes people want a type of mood and I think color can help heighten the mood which may make user want to listen more to music.

Oregon State University (https://oregonstate.edu/)

I do not like the OSU website. It is so hard to navigate without the search bar. The sections are everywhere and it makes searching things so much more difficult.

I like the layout because it is not overcrowding and it has a good layout it's just the way they organize the actual information it does not make it user friendly.

I think the pictures and the designs work well with it being a university website the colors and all makes it appealing to the eye.

An improvement I would make is organzing the information a lot better. Theres not point in having all those pretty sections if the users cant actually find what they are looking for!

Morizi Jiu-Jitsu (https://morizijiujitsu.com/)

I love this website because it is very simple to use. It is a one page website that has all the information you need.

It is not flashy and overcroweded. The pictures and words flow very well without confusing the users.

The website also follows the same color template and makes it appealing to the eye.

The website also has sections at the top that makes it easy to interact and look for the information needed.

Overall I think this website is great but I would maybe split the information to different pages so that it's not extremely long and tiring for users to read and use!
